# list-of-metabo-tools
List of some open source metabolomics tools. 

* **ProteoWizard - msconvert** - converts metabolomics file formats into other metabolomics file formats, e.g. `.d` to `.mzML`. `ProteoWizard` actually has other tools as well, it's just that `msconvert` is the most commonly used one.
* [**MetFrag**]("/assets/metfrag.md") - Annotates peak data by looking up your online database of choice (e.g. KEGG, HMDB, etc). Available as a web app (GUI), command line tool, or R package.
