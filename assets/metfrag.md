# [MetFrag2.2](https://ipb-halle.github.io/MetFrag/) (Webapp, CL(Java), R package)

### Overview:
* Looks up online databases to identify peaks, given an input list of databases
* Has a statistical score associated with each returned result (Equation 1 in the related publication), presumably a score related to “accuracy” or “confidence” in the result, ranging from 0 to 1 (not confident at all, to maximum confidence).
* All 3 versions seem very easy to use (but necessarily easy to set up)


###	MetFragCL
* 2 text file (.txt) inputs: a peak list file, which contains data to be processed, and a parameter file, which contains parameter specifications in the format that MetFragCL requires
* Can use the mzml2metfrag tool to generate the parameter file in the required format
* Looks up an online database (e.g. Pubchem), and returns a spreadsheet (.xls)
*	pre-compiled `.jar` file (java based), directly downloaded
*	Tested working on Mac with JDK 12.0.1 OSX, using the example datasets

### Available Databases

* HMDB
